## Description

This document includes some preliminary figures for discussion on content and format in preparation for the final article.

Questions to consider while reviewing the figures:  

* Is there anything about the figure that confuses you?  
* Does the figure place a clear emphasis on the most important results?  
* Is there information or ink used in the figure that is not needed?  
* Is the figure self-explanatory?  
* Is the figure layout intuitive?  
* Is the color pallette appropriate?  

The majority of the figure templates follow a common design theme. This is intentional so that the audience will not need to re-orient to a different format for new results.  They include panels of results of a dose-response relationship, with each panel representing a stratum of the data (often age group) and the outcome is diarrhea.  The exposure is either swim exposure, or _Enterococcus_ exposure in quartiles or by the US regulatory cutoff. The figures integrate information across three progressive levels of resolution for each level of exposure: number of individuals at risk and with illness, the cumulative incidence (the focus of the figure), and the adjusted cumulative incidence ratio.

A second type of template, planned for supporting information, presents a forest plot of beach-specific estimates along with pooled estimates.  Here, too, the results are stratified by environmental effect modifiers, but not by age (there is not sufficient sample size to stratify the beach-specific estimates by age).  We would envision repeating this for _Enterococcus_ exposure, stratified by point vs. non-point sources.

We have yet to develop figure templates to convey the risk of diarrhea, GI-associated medical visits, and missed days of school and work. They are coming in the next iteration.

**Swim Exposure Summary**

This figure summarizes the results of the swim exposure analyses.  The most important information that we wish to convey is:

* Differences in age in the overall risk of diarrhea
* A dose-response relationship between increasing water exposure and diarrhea incidence
* No clear effect modification by age of this relationship


**Figure X.** Incident Diarrhea Associated with Water Exposure Stratified by Age.  
Age-stratified estimates exclude 1,219 individuals with no age information.

**_Enterococcus_ EPA 1600 Quartile Exposure Summary**

This figure summarizes the results of the _Enterococcus_ EPA 1600 quartile exposure analyses.  The most important information that we wish to convey is:

* Differences in age in the overall risk of diarrhea  

* Effect modification by age in the dose-response relationship between _Entero_ 1600 and diarrhea risk
    + no clear relationship among Ages 0 to 4
    + Strongest dose-response relationship among Ages 5 to 10


**Figure X.** Incident Diarrhea Among Body Immersion Swimmers Associated with Quartiles of _Enterococcus_ EPA 1600 Concentrations.  
Age-stratified estimates exclude 717 swimmers with no age information.

**_Enterococcus_ EPA 1600 Regulatory Level Exposure Summary**

This figure summarizes the results of the _Enterococcus_ EPA 1600 regulatory cutoff exposure analyses.  The most important information that we wish to convey is:

* _Enterococcus_ levels are associated with illness only under point-source conditions (strong effect modification)


**Figure X.** Incident Diarrhea Among Body Immersion Swimmers Associated with _Enterococcus_ EPA 1600 Concentrations Above and Below Regulatory Guidelines Stratified by Whether the Beach Had An Identified Point Source of Fecal Pollution Nearby.

## Daily Incidence Plot

The most important information that we wish to convey is:

* The principal increase in risk among swimmers is in the first 3 days following a beach visit
* Swimmers who swallowed water have the highest increase in diarrhea incidence
* There is not much difference between body immersion and head immersion

**Supplemental Figure X.** Daily Incidence of Diarrhea per 1000 By Different Levels of Swim Exposure
